The actual firmware is located in [kampela](https://github.com/Kalapaja/kampela-firmware/tree/main/kampela), see included readme for instructions.

UI logic could be tested from a PC in emulator by executing [kampela-ui](https://github.com/Kalapaja/kampela-firmware/tree/main/kampela-ui) code with `cargo run`.

Screen calibration tool [kolibri](https://github.com/Kalapaja/kampela-firmware/tree/main/kolibri) is available for tuning the touch screen alignment; this might be needed if casing electromagnetic properties change noticeably.
